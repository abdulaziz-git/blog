				<p>Data is the pillar of strength of every business regardless of its size. Today, the data generation rate is much higher than it was a decade ago. So, data needs to be properly managed as it can add value to your company.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Unmanaged data can be tricky because the result from data analysis is used to make core business decisions. So, businesses need to ensure that the data they collect, organize and analyze is useful and trustworthy. Data governance is the overall management of data availability, quality, usability, consistency, and security.&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong><a href="https://datamanagementeducation.com/products/data-governance-mastery">Data governance training</a> </strong>courses from Data Management University can help you understand the basics of data governance. How to create an effective data governance framework is an art and you can learn it? The six principles that can underpin the initiative of successful data governance are given below.</p>
				<p><strong><em><u>1. Identify the opportunities</u></em></strong></p>
				<ul class="bulletic">
				<li>Why is your company doing data governance?</li>
				<li>What is the value proposition?</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Be clear of what benefits you want the data governance framework to deliver. Why is it crucial for your business? If you start data governance just for best practice purposes, then it is predestined to fail.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>You need to have a genuine understanding of &lsquo;WHY&rsquo; your company needs a data governance initiative. If you are not aware of the main reason, then you can get misdirected and side-tracked. The &lsquo;WHY&rsquo; will torch the journey and ensure your business attains what it desires from data governance.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>People will talk about generic benefits like efficiencies and better opportunities but cannot explain the &lsquo;WHYs&rsquo; when challenged. It is essential to sell data to your seniors or the money-partners because they will always be keen to know &lsquo;What&rsquo;s in it for them&rsquo;. If you cannot answer in a way they find appealing, then they will not be interested.&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong><em><u>2. Ensure to have the right knowledge and capable tools</u></em></strong></p>
				<p>Data governance framework designing is not as easy as you think, especially with little or no knowledge. There are many resources available that can be conflicting and confusing. So, before you get stuck in the analysis-paralysis framework plan to add data literacy training across the company.&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong><em><u>3. Customize data governance framework</u></em></strong></p>
				<p>A framework is a predefined set of policies, processes, and role delegations focused on bringing everyone associated on the same page during data governance implementation. There is no one-fit-all framework, so customize it based on your company's needs and goals.</p>
				<p><strong><em><u>4. Simplicity is the mantra</u></em></strong></p>
				<p>The data governance framework has to be simple. Everyone will ignore adopting a data governance framework that is complicated. You can start simple and keep adding details down the road towards maturity.</p>
				<p><strong><em><u>5. Implement in an iterative way</u></em></strong></p>
				<p>The launch of data governance is connected with simplicity. Never try to accomplish everything simultaneously because it is too much. Senior stakeholders can get overwhelmed and adopt a denial mentality. Take a slow approach and grow from there.</p>
				<p><strong><em><u>6. Change the framework as a company evolves</u></em></strong></p>
				<p>Never even assume that creating and implementing a data governance framework is a set &amp; forget proposal. Remember, it is a continuous endeavor and not a project! Review it frequently and evolve the framework as your company grows. You may need to restructure and choose a new approach as you enter new markets or acquire another company.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Follow these six key principles of the data governance framework for success!</p>
